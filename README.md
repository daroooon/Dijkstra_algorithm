# Dijkstra_algorithm

In my project, I utilized graphs and two popular algorithms, Dijkstra and Bellman-Ford, to find the shortest path between two given points.
The points represented bus stops, and the objective was to consider factors such as traffic congestion and transportation options to determine the optimal time to travel between the points. 
Essentially, the project involved optimizing travel time between bus stops using graph theory and algorithmic techniques.
